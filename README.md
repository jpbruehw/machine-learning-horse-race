# Machine Learning Algorithms and Mutual Fund Alpha: A Horse Race

## Abstract
<p>Beginning in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the study of machine learning algorithms’ ability 
to predict financial returns came into focus. Many years later, research today now shows that 
various  machine  learning  algorithms  can  accurately  model  the  return  of  actively  managed 
mutual funds. Much of this research uses the CRSP survivor bias free mutual fund database to 
train and test these models. We analyze a large dataset primarily made of up of CRSP data to 
show  both  random  forest  and  gradient  boosting  models  are  effective  at  predicting  the 
outperformance of actively managed mutual funds. Using common evaluation metrics, we also 
find there to be no statistically significant difference in predictive effectiveness between the 
two models on our dataset. We validate our findings through training and testing with multiple 
measurements of return.</p>

## Findings
<p>
While the effectiveness of a machine learning model’s ability to predict the returns of mutual 
funds depends on many factors, our findings suggest tuned random forest and gradient boosting 
models are similarly effective. Like our fictional colleague in the introduction trying to figure 
out the best way to get to work, our findings show there is more than one way to accurately reach your destination. It also shows there is no need to overcomplicate a model when it doesn’t need to be. For example, our gradient boosting model was able to run in about 30 minutes, while our random forest models took several days. 

For  decades,  being  able  to  predict  return  has  been  the  proverbial  holy  grail  of  financial modelling. Many have staked their reputations and careers on the notion that return can or can’t be  predicted  and  that  fund managers do  or  don’t  have  superior  stock  picking  skills. Any argument made in one direction or the other had an equally plausible counterargument. In today’s world of quantum computing and big data, we may be coming closer to answering these fundamental  questions.  However,  a  few  things  are  still  not  necessarily  clear.  Firstly,  how feasible it is to actually implement such algorithms to make real time investment decisions outside of the theoretical realm. Secondly, it is still up in the air to what degree skill plays a role in the return of actively managed mutual funds. 

On the other hand, many things are now clearer than ever before. Firstly, machine learning algorithms can both predict return and outperformance with a high degree of accuracy in an  ex-post  environment.  Secondly,  these  insights  can  be  used  to  construct  alpha  generating portfolios of actively managed mutual funds. We have officially entered a new era in the world of finance where one thing is abundantly clear: change is coming, and big data is the driving force behind it. There is more financial data available now than at any prior point in history and computers have never been more powerful. While some prefer to remain skeptical about machine learning, the world keeps turning whether they like it or not. The application for these powerful algorithms is multi-faceted and have the potential to disrupt almost all aspects of the financial industry. <b><i>This all begs the question: would you invest your money in a fund if a model told you to?</i></b>
